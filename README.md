# python-socket-server

in this project I created a python client server application. there is a list of customer information in database and the server program loads it at the beginning. The client program has access to this database by its interface. The user has options to add, find, delete, update and print report(of all customers information). As a challenge I improved the original design of the program to support concurrency. This way the server can handle multiple clients. 

to run the program simply pull the project then run:

```
python 
```
